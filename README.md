# jklm.fun-Bot
Its a jklm.fun bot that types the correct word.

## USAGE
It works by moving the mouse to the position of the letters indicated on the page, doing Ctrl+C and then clicking again on the previous position to proceed to write the word.

First you have to wait for the program outputs READY. Then put the mouse over the letters and hit the ALT key. Then we move the mouse to the bar where we write our word to leave the mouse there. Once this is done, each time we want to use the bot, we press LCtrl.

Open -> Wait unitl READY -> Press Alt in the letters location -> Move the mouse away -> Press Ctrl in your turn.
